            <p>River City Winery LLC is housed in the historic Baer Building, which was built in 1900 for Baer Dry Goods.  The structure has been home to various stores and offices through the years, but it was vacant and in disrepair when Losson Block LLC bought it in 2008. <br><br>River City Winery, the little winery in the heart of historic New Albany, is a dream come true for Melissa Humphrey and her mother, Rosie Bryant.  The winery has brought them the opportunity to pursue activities that they have long enjoyed.<br><br>Although the winery is the owners’ first entrepreneurial effort, the mother-daughter partners are no strangers to the winemaking process.

The space will seat about 60 people and can be used for business functions, rehearsal dinners, wedding and baby showers and holiday parties.
